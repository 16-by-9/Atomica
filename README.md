New features coming soon...

---

**Atomica** is a real-time C++ OpenGL simulation and visualization project for atoms, bonds, and molecules, featuring an interactive 3D camera. Itâ€™s designed as a sandbox for learning modern OpenGL rendering techniques, physics engines, and GPU-based effects, and it offers an interactive physics and chemistry experience.
